# ⚡ Quick Start Guide - 5 Minutes to First Lead

## 🎯 Install in 3 Steps

### 1️⃣ Download Extension
```bash
# Option A: Git clone
git clone https://github.com/mrhaker01ar/creator-lead-scraper-extension.git

# Option B: Download ZIP

### 2️⃣ Create Icons (30 seconds)

**Easiest way:**
1. Go to: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload ANY image (your logo, or just a random image)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename 3 files:
   - `favicon-16x16.png` → `icon16.png`
   - `favicon-32x32.png` → `icon48.png` (yes, use 32x32)
   - `android-chrome-192x192.png` → `icon128.png`
5. Copy these 3 files into your extension folder

**Or use this simple SVG trick:**
Create a file `icon.svg` with this content:
```svg
<svg width="128" height="128" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="128" height="128" fill="#667eea"/>
  <text x="50%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" dy=".3em" fill="white" font-size="60" font-weight="bold">AI</text>
</svg>
```
Then convert to PNG using: https://svgtopng.com/

### 3️⃣ Install in Chrome
